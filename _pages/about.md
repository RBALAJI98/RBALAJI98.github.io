Hi! I'm Rohan, an engineer working at [Gordian Software (YCW19)](https://www.gordiansoftware.com/). I have a background in backend systems and big data processing and enjoy tackling challenging engineering problems.

I have experience in architecting performant APIs, developing and launching new products, deploying and maintaining cloud infrastructure, and mentoring team members. I have a particular interest in distributed systems but ultimately I enjoy building software that makes life easier.

In my free time, I enjoy playing music, cooking (eating), and traveling. Feel free to explore my site; I'll be writing blog posts about dining experiences in Bangkok for now, with more content coming shortly!
